# VH-Cards Project Log

**Overall Purpose:**
Purpose is to build a dynamic drag & drop interface where users click on a deck of cards to reveal a
descriptive word and then decide if this word describes them accurately or not. There will be a dashboard
to collect the 5 most relevant cards, as well as a "maybe" pile and a "discard" pile.

I am using this project to practice my javascript skills as I continue to practice and learn new
javascript functionality, so I will build this project piece by piece.

Eventually, I will build this into my friends website for her to use as a coaching tool for her clients.

**Today's Progress:**
Today I used what I learned from a color flipper project to build the clickable button or deck of cards.

I was able to create the card button and the descriptor array (with set words that eventually VH will provide me) and then once clicked, the top card reveals a new word.
